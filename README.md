# Markdown Previewer

## About

The app helps to preview markdown syntax. You can type your markdown text and see what will be the output of your written syntax.
This will help you to identify mistakes on your markdown text.

## Scope

The app is using third party parser to convert markdown syntax to HTML. Currently working on making own parser for the app.
